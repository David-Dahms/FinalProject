<h2>The Market For Computing Careers (2020)</h2>
<p>
If you are visiting this page, then there is a good chance
that you are a student interested in a career in science,
technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).
What is the job market going to be like when you graduate?
</p><p>
Predicting the future is always risky, but when it comes
to forecasting the U.S. labor market, most people look to the
<a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
(US-BLS).
Every year, the US-BLS produces two sets of employment projections
for the coming decade:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>New Jobs</strong> -- jobs that did not exist previously,
representing economic growth; and </li>
<li>
<strong>Total Job Openings</strong> -- new jobs plus job openings
to replace people who have retired.</li>
</ul>
<p>
According to both of these US-BLS projections,
computing will be the safest STEM career options
for the foreseeable future.
The following table presents two charts of these US-BLS projections
for STEM careers through the year 2028 for side-by-side comparison.
The left chart presents the US-BLS <em>New Jobs</em> projections
and the right chart presents their <em>Total Job Openings</em> projections:
</p><p>
</p><table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>

<div class="container">
<svg id= "growthPercent" width="1250" height="500" style="background-color: lightblue"></svg>
<text>The white represents the actual percent. The yellow represents the percent difference between occupations.</text>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 <p>
As you can see from the chart on the left,
the US government predicts that the top five
<span class="caps">STEM</span> jobs in terms of growth will all be in computing.
</p> <p>
In particular, <strong>the US-BLS predicts that each year,
there will be nearly 30,000 new software development jobs,
over 8,000 new computing support jobs,
over 5,000 new systems analysts jobs,
over 3,000 information security jobs, and
over 4,000 other computing jobs.
</strong>
No other STEM career is expected to generate even 3000 new jobs per year.
</p> <p>
The chart on the right paints a similar picture
when retiree-replacements are considered:
the top five STEM careers with the most job opportunities per year are:
software development, computing support, systems analysts,
network/systems administration, and
other computer occupations.

    For the foreseeable future of science, technology, engineering,
    and mathematics jobs in the US,
    <strong>
    more than 3 out of 5 of the job openings are going to be in computing!
    </strong>
    It is worth mentioning that this is not a fluke -- all of
    these numbers are fairly consistent with those from
    <a href="http://cs.calvin.edu/images/department/jobs/2026/">
    two</a>, 
    <a href="http://cs.calvin.edu/images/department/jobs/2024/">
    four</a>, 
    <a href="http://cs.calvin.edu/images/department/jobs/2022/">
    six</a>, and
    <a href="http://cs.calvin.edu/images/department/jobs/2020/">
    eight</a> years ago.
    </p>
    <p></p><p>
    What kind of "computing" careers are these? 
    The bar-chart to the right of each pie-chart
    breaks down the "computing" job openings
    into the different career categories, and shows the variety of careers
    that are available for students who study computing.  
    As can be seen in the chart on the left,
    the US-BLS is predicting that <strong>over 49% of the <em>New Jobs</em> in 
    STEM will be in software development (aka software engineering) alone,
    compared to less than 12% in the combined branches of traditional engineering!</strong>
    With respect to <em>Total Job Openings</em>, the chart on the right predicts that
    there will be more openings in
    software development/engineering than there will be in all the branches
    of traditional engineering <em>combined</em>.
    </p> <p>
    Why will there be so many software development/engineering jobs?
    We see two main reasons:
    </p><ul>
     <li>
    One reason is the <em>mobile computing market</em>.
    It used to be that every company wanted a website (and they still do),
    creating demand for web developers.
    But today,
    most companies also want apps for smart-phone and tablet devices,
    whether running Apple's iOS operating system or
    Google's Android operating system.
    The need to create and maintain these apps
    is one factor that is creating a huge demand for software developers.
    <p></p>
    </li><li>
    Another reason is that manufacturers are increasingly embedding computers
    into appliances like refrigerators, ovens, water heaters, and so on;
    this is creating the so-called
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a>.
    These computers are being embedded into a wide range of devices, 
    from "smart speakers" (e.g., Amazon Echo/Alexa, Apple Homepod/Siri, and Google Nest/Assistant)
    to smart thermostats (e.g., <a href="https://nest.com">Nest</a>)
    to smart doorbells (e.g., <a href="https://ring.com">Ring</a>)
    to the autonomous vehicles currently being designed by automobile manufacturers.
    All of these embedded computers require software to do anything useful,
    adding to the demand for software developers.
    These embedded computers will communicate by sending data across networks,
    and this data will be stored in databases,
    creating demand for networking professionals
    and database administrators.
    When things go wrong, the people using these devices will need technical support,
    creating demand for support specialists.
    Together, these developments are creating a huge demand for people
    with advanced computing skills,
    especially in software development.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Note that basic computer literacy
    (i.e., knowing how to use Microsoft Windows, Word, Excel, or Powerpoint)
    or CAD-design skills will <em>not</em> qualify you for one of these jobs.
    Most of these jobs require advanced computing skills
    that you will only gain by studying
    computer science and/or software engineering.
    
    </p><h3>The Competition</h3>
    <p>
    When you are trying to get a job, a major consideration is how much competition is there
    for the job?
    To provide some insight into this question,
    our final chart compares the US-BLS projections for <em>Total Job Openings</em> in the various STEM areas
    against the most recent (2017) National Science Foundation data
    for the number of bachelors degrees being awarded in those areas:
    </p><p>
    
    </p><p>
    (Click on the chart for a larger image.)
    </p><p>
    As can readily be seen above:
    </p><ul>
     <li>
      In <em>Computing</em>, there are far more job openings than college graduates to fill them
       -- the projected openings/grads ratio is 5.58!
       For comparison purposes, this ration was 5.76 two years ago.
       The number of computing grads has increased markedly in the past two years,
        but the US-BLS is projecting over 56,000 more computing jobs <em>per year</em>
        than they were two years ago.
       So long as this demand continues to exceed the supply,
       the level of competition for computing jobs should be relatively low.
     </li><li>
      In <em>Bio Sciences</em>, there are far more college graduates than there are job openings.
       (The projected openings/grads ratio is 0.29!
       Hopefully some of those students will end up in the health sector,
       where there are better job prospects.)
    </li></ul>
    <p></p><h3>Preparing for a Career</h3>
    <p></p><p>
    In his 1993 book 
    <a href="http://gladwell.com/outliers/">Outliers</a>,
    Malcom Gladwell argued that anyone who practices a skill for 10,000 hours can
    master that skill. 
    If that is true, then it follows that
    if (for example) you want to prepare yourself for one of those numerous careers in
    software development,
    your best strategy is to choose a college major that will give you lots of
    practice actually developing software. 
    </p><p>
    More generally, the US-BLS projections predict that 
    most of the STEM careers are going to be in computing.
    If you want to maximize your chances of success in
    one of these careers,
    choose a computing-related major that provides lots of hands-on practice in that
    area.
    </p><p>
    However, employers also place high value on communication, collegiality, being
    able to work in groups, and other "people" skills.
    To maximize your career opportunities, choose a college or university that will
    help you develop these skills.
    A liberal arts education is especially good at helping you develop these skills,
    specifically: critical thinking, writing, speaking,
    and giving presentations for non-technical audiences.
    
    </p><h3>The Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
    In the 21<sup>st</sup> century,
    computing technology (especially software) affects more and more of our day-to-day
    lives, 
    and people are needed to create and maintain that technology.
    </p><p>
    If you want the best possible preparation for the vast majority of tomorrow's
    STEM careers, the smart move is to major in a computing-related discipline
    (computer science and/or software engineering) at a college
    or university that will also help you develop your "people" skills.
